# **Power Base Code of Conduct**

## **1\. Our Mission & Pledge**

Power Base is an on-chain organization dedicated to shepherding the development and adoption of the Powers protocol. We are a community of developers, funders, and users who collaborate to build and manage decentralized governance tools.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. We value constructive collaboration, transparency, and acting in good faith to further the mission of the protocol. This Code of Conduct applies to all participants in all on-chain and off-chain spaces.

## **2\. Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies to all participants of the Power Base organization, including (but not limited to):

* **Admins**  
* **Contributors** (Documentation, Frontend, Protocol)  
* **Funders**  
* **Members**  
* **Grant Recipients**  
* **Public Participants** (those who may not hold a role but interact with the community)

This code applies to all official Power Base spaces, including:

* **On-chain actions** (governance proposals, voting, vetoes, executions)  
* **Off-chain communication channels** (Discord, forums, community calls)  
* **Code repositories** (GitHub issues, pull requests, commit messages)  
* **Events** (virtual and in-person)

## **3\. Expected Behaviors**

* **Be Respectful:** Communicate respectfully with all participants. Disagreement is normal, but personal attacks, harassment, or exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.  
* **Act in Good Faith:** Use all on-chain powers and off-chain influence for the benefit of the protocol. This is our most important principle.  
  * **For Voters:** Evaluate proposals based on their merit and alignment with the organization's mission.  
  * **For Funders:** Use the veto power responsibly to protect the organization from proposals you genuinely believe are harmful, not to frivolously block progress or for personal gain.  
  * **For Contributors:** Use your approval powers (e.g., in the pool creation "sieve") diligently. Do not stall or block proposals without clear, constructive reasoning.  
  * **For Proposers:** Submit proposals that are clear, well-researched, and aligned with the community's goals.  
* **Be Constructive:** Whether you are providing feedback on a proposal, a pull request, or in a discussion, do so constructively.  
* **Be Transparent:** When possible, discuss intentions for significant on-chain actions (e.g., new pool proposals, constitutional changes) in public off-chain channels to gather community feedback.  
* **Be Mindful:** Be mindful of your fellow participants. We are a global community from diverse backgrounds.

## **4\. Unacceptable Behaviors**

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* Violence, threats of violence, or incitement of violence against any individual or group.  
* Discriminatory language or behavior related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, or other personal characteristics.  
* Public or private harassment, stalking, or doxxing (publishing private information).  
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.  
* Deliberate intimidation or disruption of discussions or on-chain governance.

**Specifically for On-Chain Governance:**

* **Abuse of Powers:** Knowingly and repeatedly acting in bad faith. This includes, but is not limited to:  
  * Spamming the governance system with low-quality or malicious proposals.  
  * Frivolously vetoing all proposals to halt the organization.  
  * Colluding to use approval powers to stall the pool creation process without cause.  
* **Gaming the System:** Any attempt to gain an unfair advantage in the governance process, such as Sybil attacks (using multiple addresses to gain outsized voting power) or misrepresenting information to mislead voters.  
* **Malicious Commits:** Submitting commits to the repository (e.g., to the "gitbook", "frontend", or "solidity" paths) with the malicious intent of falsely claiming a Contributor role via the RoleByGitSignature law.

## **5\. Enforcement & Consequences**

### **Off-Chain Enforcement**

In community channels like Discord or forums, moderators or the Admin may take the following actions in response to a violation:

1. **Written Warning:** A private or public warning.  
2. **Temporary Mute/Ban:** A temporary removal from the communication channel.  
3. **Permanent Ban:** A permanent removal from the communication channel.

### **On-Chain Enforcement**

Violations of this Code of Conduct, especially those related to the "Abuse of Powers," can have on-chain consequences. The community's primary tool for enforcement is the governance system itself.

1. **Escalation:** For severe or repeated violations, especially those demonstrating bad faith, any Member may submit an on-chain proposal using the **"Remove Role"** law.  
2. **Community Vote:** The Members will vote on this proposal. A successful vote will revoke the offending user's role(s), removing their on-chain governance powers. This is the community's ultimate enforcement mechanism.  
3. **Admin Veto:** The Admin role has the power to veto a "Remove Role" proposal, acting as a backstop against malicious or unfair removal attempts.  
4. **Blacklisting:** In extreme, unambiguous cases of malicious activity (e.g., attempting to exploit a contract), the Admin may use the blacklistAddress function to immediately revoke all permissions. This is a measure of last resort for protecting the protocol.

## **6\. Reporting**

If you are the subject of or witness any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact the Admin or community moderators privately. All reports will be kept confidential and investigated promptly.
