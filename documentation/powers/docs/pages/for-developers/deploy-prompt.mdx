# Deploy prompt to write documentation on how to deploy your own organisation. 

1. There need to be three sections: general logic, frontend deployment, and smart contract deployment.
2. The general logic section should explain the steps needed to deploy an organisation using Powers, including any prerequisites and considerations.
3. The frontend deployment section should provide detailed instructions on how to set up and deploy the Powers frontend, including any necessary configurations.
4. The smart contract deployment section should outline the steps to deploy the Powers smart contracts, including any required tools and deployment scripts.

---
## 1. General Logic
Explain the deployment logic: first a vanilla powers contract is deployed, then laws are configured, then send to the constitute function in Powers. 
This logic is the same for dpeloyment via frontend or smart contract scripts. 

There are no no-code solutions yet, so all deployment requires some coding knowledge. 
But it is made as simple as possible via the frontend or deployment scripts. 

## 2. Frontend Deployment
Explain how to deploy via the frontend: A single file in the frontend/organisations/ folder contains all logic to deploy an organisation.
Examples are: PowerBase.ts and Powers101.ts. 

## 3. Smart Contract Deployment
Explain how to deploy via smart contract scripts: there are deployment scripts in the solidity/script/ folder.
Examples is DeployTestOrg.s.sol
