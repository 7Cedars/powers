# Protocol development

## Principles

There are several principles that guide the development of the Powers protocol.

* **Trustless.** The protocol operates in a trustless manner: It is self-sovereign, verifiable, censorship resistant, accesible, transparent and voluntary. There are no restriction to the type of governance structures that are implemented using Powers.
* **Open source.** The core protocol, laws and app are open source.
* **Modularity.** Laws provide an open and fully modular layer of smart contracts that integrates with on- and off-chain services, existing DAOs, as well as with other implementations of the protocol. Anyone should be able to create their own laws.
* **On-chain first.** The protocol opts for on-chain storage solutions where possible, while remaining vigilant regarding excessive gas usage. It avoids solutions that rely on (gated) APIs or RPCs. 
* **Inclusivity.** While the protocol has an on-chain first ethos, it should seamlessly integrate with off-chain solutions and protocols deployed on other chains. Barriers to use should be usable as low as possible.
* **Security.** No protocol will ever be a 100% safe. But a role restricted governance protocol allows for additional safety checks by eliminating single points of failure. Protocol and law development will always aim to leverage these security capabilities and include continuous security auditing .
* **Community.** Protocol development and security demand constant attention. The ultimate aim is to create a sustainable community that develops and secures the protocol.
* **Decentralization through pluralism.** Powers aims to revolutionize on-chain governance. Dividing powers within a governance protocol along roles that need to be assigned, we can - finally - begin to truly decentralize power in DAOs.

## Milestones

### v0.5

* Development example organisations that integrate with existing protocols. 
* Testing, auditing of core protocols and selected laws. 
* and more. 

### v0.4 (current)

* Development additional laws and deployment Power Base organisation.
* First security audit core protocol.
* Optimized core protocol for on-chain data storage and retrieval.
* Improved error handling.
* Zero-code UI for deploying demo on-chain organisations.
* User portal UI for effiicient governance interactions.  

### v0.3 

* Implement integration modules for existing protocols. 
* Implement integration for off-chain services.
* Revise naming of function and variables in Powers.sol.
* Refactor laws into singleton contracts. Refactor Powers accordingly.
* App for live demo's Powers implementations.

### v0.2

* Simplified Powers.sol
* Implemented modular laws.
* Implemented first dynamic UI / UX to interact with a wide range of governance structures.
* Renamed the protocol to Powers protocol.

### v0.1

* First PoC of Role restricted governance protocol. Initially named Separated Powers.
* Build for the RnDao's CollabTech hackathon in Oct-Nov 2024.
