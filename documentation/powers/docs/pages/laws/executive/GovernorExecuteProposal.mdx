# GovernorExecuteProposal

GovernorExecuteProposal is an executive law that enables the execution of governance proposals on a configured Governor contract. It provides a mechanism to execute proposals that have succeeded in the governance process.

## Overview

This law provides a mechanism to:
- Execute governance proposals that have succeeded
- Validate proposal state before execution
- Execute proposal actions directly
- Integrate with standard governance frameworks
- Track proposal execution

## Configuration

When adopting a GovernorExecuteProposal instance, one parameter must be provided:

1. `governorContract` (address): The address of the Governor contract to execute proposals on

## Usage

### Proposing an Action

When calling the law, four parameters must be provided:

1. `targets` (address[]): Array of target contract addresses for the proposal
2. `values` (uint256[]): Array of ETH values to send with each call
3. `calldatas` (bytes[]): Array of encoded function call data
4. `description` (string): Human-readable description of the proposal

### Execution Flow

1. **Parameter Validation**
   - Verifies governor contract is configured
   - Validates proposal parameters
   - Checks array length consistency
   - Ensures description is not empty

2. **Proposal Validation**
   - Gets proposal ID from governor contract
   - Validates proposal exists
   - Checks proposal state is "Succeeded"
   - Ensures proposal is ready for execution

3. **Proposal Execution**
   - Returns proposal actions for direct execution
   - Bypasses governor contract execution
   - Executes actions directly

4. **State Management**
   - Records proposal execution
   - Updates governance state
   - Tracks execution history

## Technical Specifications

### State Variables

```solidity
mapping(bytes32 lawHash => address governorContract) public governorContracts;
```

### Functions

#### `initializeLaw`
```solidity
function initializeLaw(
    uint16 index,
    string memory nameDescription,
    bytes memory inputParams,
    bytes memory config
) public override
```
- Initializes law with configuration parameters
- Sets up Governor contract address
- Configures proposal execution parameters

#### `handleRequest`
```solidity
function handleRequest(
    address caller,
    address powers,
    uint16 lawId,
    bytes memory lawCalldata,
    uint256 nonce
) public view virtual override returns (
    uint256 actionId,
    address[] memory targets,
    uint256[] memory values,
    bytes[] memory calldatas
)
```
- Processes the proposal execution request
- Validates proposal parameters and state
- Prepares proposal actions for execution
- Returns execution data

### Error Conditions

1. **Configuration Errors**
   - "GovernorExecuteProposal: Governor contract not configured"
   - Invalid governor contract address

2. **Parameter Errors**
   - "GovernorExecuteProposal: No targets provided"
   - "GovernorExecuteProposal: Targets and values length mismatch"
   - "GovernorExecuteProposal: Targets and calldatas length mismatch"
   - "GovernorExecuteProposal: Description cannot be empty"

3. **Proposal Errors**
   - "GovernorExecuteProposal: Proposal not found"
   - "GovernorExecuteProposal: Proposal not succeeded"
   - Invalid proposal state

4. **Validation Errors**
   - Zero address governor contract
   - Empty targets array
   - Mismatched array lengths
   - Empty description
