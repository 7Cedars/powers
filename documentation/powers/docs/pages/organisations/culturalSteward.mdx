# Cultural Stewardship DAO Specification

## Organisational Structure & Context

### *Vision & Mission*

[cite_start]The Cultural Stewardship DAO is a multi-layered ecosystem designed to manage the interplay between physical spaces, ideational concepts, and digital manifestations[cite: 52]. [cite_start]Its primary aim is to act as a steward for cultural assets through a "Layered Approach"[cite: 52], ensuring a clear separation of concerns between the legal entity, the repository, and community engagement.

### *Architecture: Parent & Sub-DAOs*

The organisation operates through a **Parent Organisation** and three distinct types of **Sub-DAOs**:

1.  **Parent Organisation**: The central governance body holding the Treasury (Safe). It manages permissions and funding for the ecosystem but does not act as a sub-DAO itself.
2.  **Sub-DAO #1 (Physical)**: Manages physical manifestations (e.g., access to spaces, rent, legal logs).
3.  **Sub-DAO #2 (Ideational)**: Manages concepts, digital interfaces, and legislative frameworks.
4.  **Sub-DAO #3 (Digital)**: Manages code repositories, commits, and inter-DAO recognition.

### *Treasury Management*

* **Centralised Treasury**: Funds can only be sent to the Safe owned by the Parent Organisation. Sub-DAOs do not control their own payable addresses.
* **Fund Flow**: Sub-DAOs request funding or allowance. The Parent Organisation processes these requests through a governance flow involving Executive execution and Member vetoes.
* **Role Logic**: To prevent security vulnerabilities from overlapping roles, the ecosystem utilises an **ERC-1155** contract for role and token management.

## Roles

*Note: Roles are divided between the Parent Organisation and Sub-DAOs.*

<div class="table-mandates">
| **Role Id** | **Role name** | **Selection criteria** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Admin (Parent) | Assigned at deployment; (re-)assigns among themselves. |
| 1 | Members (Parent) | Holders of Proof of Membership in Sub-DAO #1, #2, or #3. (Not activity-based). |
| 2 | Executives (Parent) | Elected every N-months from among Members. |
| 3 | Conveners (Sub-DAOs) | Elected every N-months from among Sub-DAO members. |
| 4 | Ideational Parent | Assigned at creation of Sub-DAO #1. |
| 5 | Members (Physical) | Holders of specific POAPs (e.g., n-POAPs assigned by Conveners). |
| 6 | Members (Ideational) | Proof of activity via requesting ERC-1155 tokens/NFTs. |
| 7 | Members (Digital) | Proof of accepted code commits. |
| … | Public | Everyone. |
</div>

## On-chain Mandates

### *Executive Mandates (Parent Organisation)*

The Parent Organisation manages the ecosystem infrastructure and treasury distribution.

| Executives | Set Allowed Tokens | BespokeAction.sol | "address token" | Whitelist.add(token) | Members did not veto |
</div>

### *Executive Mandates (Sub-DAOs)*

Mandates specific to the Physical (#1), Ideational (#2), and Digital (#3) manifestations.

<div class="table-mandates">
| **Role** | **Name & Description** | **Base contract** | **User Input** | **Executable Output** | **Conditions** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Conveners (#1) | Manage Physical Access | BespokeAction.sol | "address user", "bool access" | AccessControl.set(user, access) | Executives can veto |
| Conveners (#1) | Log Legal Contract | BespokeAction.sol | "string ipfsHash" | Registry.log(hash) | Executives can veto |
| Conveners (#1) | Pay Receipts | BespokeAction.sol | "address member", "uint256 amount" | ParentSafe.transfer(member, amount) | Member submitted receipt |
| Ideational Parent (#1) | Request Interface Build | StatementOfIntent.sol | "string requirements" | none | Conveners must OK |
| Ideational Parent (#1) | Pay Project | BespokeAction.sol | "address project", "uint256 amount" | ParentSafe.transfer(project, amount) | Conveners execute payment |
| Members (#2) | Propose New Law | StatementOfIntent.sol | "string lawText" | DAO.adoptLaw(lawText) | Conveners execute, Executives can veto |
| Sub-DAO (#3) | Pay Project Sub-DAO | BespokeAction.sol | "address siblingDao", "uint256 amount" | ParentSafe.transfer(siblingDao, amount) | Sibling DAO must be recognised |
</div>

### *Electoral Mandates (Assigning Roles)*

| Members (Parent) | Elect Executives | Election.sol | "address candidate" | Assigns Role 2 (Executive) | N-month cycle |
| Members (Sub) | Elect Conveners | Election.sol | "address candidate" | Assigns Role 3 (Convener) | N-month cycle |
| Conveners (#1) | Grant Membership (#1) | BespokeAction.sol | "address user" | Mint POAP / Assign Role 5 | User has sufficient POAPs |

| Admin (#3) | Grant Membership (#3) | BespokeAction.sol | "address contributor" | Assign Role 7 | Proof of accepted commits |
</div>

## Off-chain Operations

### *Dispute Resolution*

Disputes regarding ambiguous mandate conditions or malicious actions by role-holders will be addressed through community discussion in the official communication channels.
Final arbitration lies with the **Admin role** of the Parent Organisation if consensus cannot be reached.

### *Code of Conduct*

All participants are expected to act in good faith to further the mission of the Cultural Stewardship DAO. The ecosystem relies on the harmonic interaction between the physical, ideational, and digital layers; disruption in one layer may affect the others.

### *Communication Channels*

Official proposals, discussions, and announcements take place on the DAO's Discord server and community forum.
Note: Sub-DAOs may maintain their own specific channels for "Physical" (Space logistics), "Ideational" (Brainstorming), and "Digital" (Code reviews).

## Description of Governance

The Cultural Stewardship DAO implements a federated governance model.

* **Remit**: To manage a shared treasury (Parent) while empowering specialised Sub-DAOs to operate with autonomy in their respective domains (Physical, Ideational, Digital).
* **Separation of Powers**:
    * **Financial Control**: Centralised at the Parent level to ensure security.
    * **Operational Control**: Decentralised to Sub-DAOs to ensure agility.
    * **Checks and Balances**: Most Sub-DAO actions (like laws or physical access) are executable by local Conveners but subject to Veto by the Parent Executives.
* **Executive Paths**:
    * **Funding**: Sub-DAOs do not hold funds. They act as "cost centres" that request payment execution from the Parent.
    * **Legislation**: Sub-DAOs can create their own internal laws and roles, provided they are not vetoed by the Parent DAO.
* **Summary**: This structure allows for a "Physical manifestation DAO" to worry about rent and keys, while a "Digital manifestation DAO" worries about commits and code, all bound by a common economic and constitutional framework.

## Risk Assessment

### Role Collision
Because roles can be dynamically assigned by Sub-DAOs, there is a risk of overlapping roles creating security vulnerabilities. The system mitigates this by using an **ERC-1155 contract** to ensure unique identification across the ecosystem.

### Dependency Chains
The "Digital DAO" (#3) relies on the recognition of Sibling DAOs (#1 & #2) to execute payments. If recognition logic fails or desynchronises, operations may stall.
