# Powers 101 Specification

## Organisational Structure & Context

### *Vision & Mission*

Powers 101 is a simple DAO designed to demonstrate the core concepts of the Powers protocol. It provides a basic governance structure with a separation of powers between delegates, members, and an admin, making it an ideal starting point for understanding how the protocol works.

### *Treasury Management*

The organization's actions (including treasury management) are managed through proposals initiated by members and executed by delegates. This model allows for a decentralized approach to treasury management, where the community can propose actions and the elected delegates are responsible for carrying them out. 

Note that for demonstration purposes, there are no checks on allocation of roles. 

## Roles

<div class="table-laws">
| **Role Id** | **Role name** | **Selection criteria** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Admin | Admin role assigned at deployment. |
| 1 | Members | Anyone can self-select to become a member. |
| 2 | Delegates | Anyone can self-select to become a delegate. |
| … | Public | Everyone. |
</div> 

## On-chain Laws

### *Executive Laws (executing actions)*

<div class="table-laws">
| **Role** | **Name & Description** | **Base contract** | **User Input** | **Executable Output** | **Conditions** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Members | Propose Action | StatementOfIntent.sol | "address[] Targets", "uint256[] Values", "bytes[] Calldatas" | none | 51% success, 20% quorum, 5 minute voting period |
| Admin | Veto Action | StatementOfIntent.sol | "address[] Targets", "uint256[] Values", "bytes[] Calldatas" | none | Proposal must exist |
| Delegates | Execute Action | OpenAction.sol | (from proposal) | Executes the proposed action | 77% success, 50% quorum, 5 minute voting period, 3 minute delay, proposal must exist, not vetoed |
</div> 

### *Electoral Laws (assigning roles)*

<div class="table-laws">
| **Role** | **Name & Description** | **Base contract** | **User Input** | **Executable Output** | **Conditions** |

| Public | Become a Delegate | SelfSelect.sol | "uint256 roleId" | Assigns the caller the delegate role. | Public access, 25 block throttle. |
</div> 

### *Constitutional Laws (adopting and revoking laws)*

There are no specific constitutional laws defined in the Powers 101 organization. Law management is handled by the Admin role.

## Off-chain Operations

### *Dispute Resolution*

Disputes regarding ambiguous law conditions or malicious actions by role-holders will be addressed through community discussion in the official communication channels, with final arbitration by the Admin role if consensus cannot be reached.

### *Code of Conduct / Ethics*

All participants are expected to act in good faith to further the mission of Powers 101. This includes respectful communication, constructive feedback, and responsible use of powers.

### *Communication Channels*

Official proposals, discussions, and announcements take place on the Powers 101 Discord server and community forum.

## Description of Governance

Powers 101 is a decentralized organization designed to showcase the fundamental governance principles of the Powers protocol.

* **Remit**: The primary function is to provide a simple, transparent, and educational platform for users to learn about decentralized governance.
* **Roles**: Roles are straightforward: anyone can become a **Member**, members can nominate themselves to be **Delegates**, and an **Admin** role manages the system.
* **Executive Paths**:
  * **Proposal Lifecycle**: Members propose actions, the Admin can veto them, and Delegates execute approved proposals.
* **Summary**: The governance structure of Powers 101 is a minimalist implementation of the Powers protocol, demonstrating a clear separation of powers and providing a hands-on learning experience for decentralized governance.
