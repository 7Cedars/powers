# Powers 101 Organisation Specification

## Organisational Structure & Context

### *Vision & Mission*

Powers 101 is a simple DAO designed to demonstrate the core concepts of the Powers protocol. It provides a basic governance structure with a separation of powers between delegates, members, and an admin, making it an ideal starting point for understanding how the protocol works.

### *Treasury Management*

The organization's actions (including treasury management) are managed through proposals initiated by members and executed by delegates. This model allows for a decentralized approach to treasury management, where the community can propose actions and the elected delegates are responsible for carrying them out. 

Note that for demonstration purposes, there are no checks on allocation of roles. 

## Roles

| **Role Id** | **Role name** | **Selection criteria** |

| 1 | Members | Anyone can self-select to become a member. |
| 2 | Delegates | Anyone can self-select to become a delegate. |
| … | Public | Everyone. |
</div> 

## On-chain Laws

</div>
