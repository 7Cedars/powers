I am building a blockchain protocol for institutional governance called Powers. 
- The documentation for the protocol can be found at powers-docs.vercel.app. 
- the github repo is github.com/7cedars/powers

The task is to create specs for an organisation build using the Powers protocol. You will receive an empty spec sheet that only include the general description of what the organisation should do and what existing contracts it should interact with. Your task is to fill out the task sheet further. 

As examples you can use the follow spec sheets: 
- powers-docs.vercel.app/organisations/powers101.mdx 
- powers-docs.vercel.app/organisations/powerBase.mdx 

IMPORTANT: 
- please return an .mdx file as if it is code. 
- keep close to the layouting used in the examples.
