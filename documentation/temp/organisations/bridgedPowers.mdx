# Bridged Powers Organisaitonal Specs

## Organisational Structure & Context

### *Vision & Mission*

Bridged Powers is an example of a cross-chain governance system. It is deployed on the Optimism's Superchain stack. 
It consists of a central powers contract (OP Sepolia) and local deployments on Base, Zora and Mode. 

Each local powers contract has the power to:
- Continously assign and revoke citizens status, elect delegate token holders.  
- Periodically elect members to an executive and security council. 
- Delegates can propose actions, security council can veto, executive council executes. 
- Citizens adopt new laws (see below). 

In addition to the above, the central Powers has
- a general executive and security council that consists of all addresses elected in local councils. 
- a governance path that links Governor.sol deployments in all the local chains. 

Local powers deployments can gain new powers through laws that are created centrally: 
- Token holders in each chain propose, the central security council can veto, and the central executive council executes. 
- Citizens in the local deployments can then fetch the new laws to their own powers to be used in their governance. 

### *Treasury Management*

Each local deployment has its own treasury. No funds are transferred between chains or from OP sepolia to other chains.
