# **Allo Grant Organisation Specification**

## **Organisational Structure & Context**

### ***Vision & Mission***

This organisation is a decentralized grant-giving body that uses the Powers protocol to govern an Allo v2 instance. Its mission is to provide a transparent and community-driven platform for funding public goods and open-source projects. The organisation will use the DirectGrantsLite strategy from Allo v2 for its initial implementation.

### ***Treasury Management***

The organisation's treasury is managed through a combination of the Powers protocol and the Allo v2 DirectGrantsLite strategy. Members can propose the creation of new grant pools, which are then managed by a dedicated Pool Manager. Funds are held in the Allo v2 contract and are distributed to grantees based on community votes.

## **Roles**

| *Role Id* | *Role name* | *Selection criteria.* |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | Admin | Admin role assigned at deployment. |
| 1 | Members | Anyone can self-select to become a member. |
| 2 | Pool Manager | Elected by members to manage Allo v2 pools. |
| 3 | Grantees | Individuals or teams that have received a grant. |
| â€¦ | Public | Everyone. |

### ***Code of Conduct / Ethics***

## **Description of Governance**

This organisation is a decentralized autonomous organisation (DAO) that leverages the Powers protocol for its governance layer and Allo v2 for its grant-making operations.

* **Remit**: The primary function of the organisation is to fund public goods and open-source projects through a transparent and community-driven process.  
* **Roles**: The organisation has a simple role structure with an **Admin** for managing the system, **Members** for proposing and voting on actions, a **Pool Manager** for managing grant pools, and **Grantees** who receive funding.  
* **Executive Paths**:  
  * **Pool Creation**: Members propose the creation of new grant pools, the Admin can veto them, and the Pool Manager executes the creation of the pool on Allo v2.  
  * **Grant Lifecycle**: Anyone can apply for a grant. Members vote on grant applications, and the Pool Manager allocates the funds to the approved grantees.  
* **Summary**: The governance model is designed to be simple and transparent, with a clear separation of powers between the different roles. This allows for a decentralized and community-driven approach to grant-making, while still maintaining a level of oversight and control through the Admin role.
