# Powers 101 Organisation Specification

## Organisational Structure & Context

### *Vision & Mission*

Powers 101 is a simple DAO designed to demonstrate the core concepts of the Powers protocol. It provides a basic governance structure with a separation of powers between delegates, members, and an admin, making it an ideal starting point for understanding how the protocol works.

### *Treasury Management*

The organization's treasury is managed through proposals initiated by members and executed by delegates. This model allows for a decentralized approach to treasury management, where the community can propose actions and the elected delegates are responsible for carrying them out.

## Roles

| 0 | Admin | Admin role assigned at deployment. |
| 1 | Members | Anyone can self-select to become a member. |
| 2 | Delegates | Elected by members through a formal election process. |
