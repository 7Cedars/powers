## Organisational Structure & Context

### *Vision & Mission*

Powers Labs is the non-profit on-chain organisation that shepherds the development of the Powers protocol. 

### *Treasury Management*

Its principle task is to distribute funding into four development areas: protocol, frontend, documentation and marketing. It does this through allocating grants in these areas by the people that are active in these areas themselves. Decisions on how to distribute available funds *between* these four areas are taken collectively.

### *Funding Policy*

The funding policy outlines the distribution of grants across four key development areas: protocol, frontend, documentation, and marketing. Decisions regarding the allocation of available funds between these areas are made collectively by active participants.
