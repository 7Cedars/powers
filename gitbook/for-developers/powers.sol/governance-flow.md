# Governance flow

Powers and Laws together allow communities to build any governance structure that fit their needs. It is possible to define the mechanisms through which a role is assigned, the power it has, how roles check and balance each other, and under what conditions this can change.

This is possible because laws provide a composable governance layer around the Powers.sol engine. Each governance action is initiated in reference to a law, and is executed in line with its role restriction, checks and allowed actions.

The following is a diagram of the governance flow in the Powers protocol:
