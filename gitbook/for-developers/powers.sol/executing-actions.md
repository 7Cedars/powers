# Executing actions

ðŸš§ **This page is incomplete.** ðŸš§

Executing an action in the Powers protocol follows a request and callback logic. &#x20;

## Requesting an action

An account requests an action by calling the `request` function. It takes the following parameters:&#x20;

* The ID of the law that will be called.&#x20;
* The calldata&#x20;
* A random nonce &#x20;
* A brief description (or uri to an IPFS document)

When called, the function checks if the caller has the appropriate role Id to call this law. If this and other checks pass, the `request` function sends the calldata and nonce to the target law and emits a `ActionRequested` event.&#x20;

If the call to the law is successful, the target law will return a call to the `fulfill` function. This function can only be called by active laws and will only execute actions that have passed through the `request` function.&#x20;

If all checks pass, the `fulfill` function will attempt to execute all the actions that were included in the response from the law.

## ActionId&#x20;

At the moment `request` is called, the function creates an action Id by hashing lawId, lawCalldata and the random nonce. This action Id is used to track the action throughout its life cycle.

*



&#x20;\- and beyond: the action Id is also used by other laws to check on the status of specific actions. &#x20;
