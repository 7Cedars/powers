# Protocol development

## Principles

There are several principles that guide the development of the Powers protocol.

* **Open source.** The core protocol, laws and app are and will always will remain open source.
* **Modularity.** Laws provide, and will always provide, an open and fully modular layer of smart contracts that integrate with on- and off-chain services, existing DAOs, as well as with other implementations of the protocol. Anyone should be able to create their own laws.
* **On-chain first.** Choose on-chain storage solutions where possible, while remaining vigilant regarding excessive gas usage. Avoid solutions that will require excessive log fetching and indexing as they lead to centralised power around (UI/UX) access to governance protocols.  &#x20;
* **Inclusivity.** While the protocol has an on-chain first ethos, it should seamlessly integrate with off-chain solutions and protocols deployed on other chains.   &#x20;
* **Security.** No protocol will ever be a 100% safe. But a role restricted governance protocol allows for additional safety checks by eliminating single points of failure. Protocol and law development will always aim to leverage these security capabilities and include continuous security auditing .
* **Community.** Protocol development and security demand constant attention. The ultimate aim is to create a sustainable community that develops and secures the protocol.
* **Decentralization through pluralism.** Powers aims to revolutionize on-chain governance. Dividing powers within a governance protocol along roles that need to be assigned, we can - finally - begin to truly decentralize power in DAOs.

## Milestones

### v0.4

* Development additional laws and example use cases.
* Security audits core protocol and laws.
* Optimize core protocol.
* Improve error handling.
* Zero-code UI for deploying on-chain organisations.

### v0.3 (current)

* Implement integration modules for existing protocols. (wip)
* Implement integration for off-chain services. (wip)
* Revise naming of function and variables in Powers.sol.
* Refactor laws into singleton contracts. Refactor Powers accordingly.
* App for live demo's Powers implementations.

### v0.2

* Simplified Powers.sol
* Implemented modular laws.
* Implemented dynamic UI / UX to interact with a wide range of governance structures.
* Renamed the protocol to Powers protocol.

### v0.1

* First PoC of Role restricted governance protocol. Initially named Separated Powers.
* Build for the RnDao's CollabTech hackathon in Oct-Nov 2024.
