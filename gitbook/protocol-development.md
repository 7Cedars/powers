# Protocol development

## Aims

There are several aims and ethos that guide the development of the Powers protocol.

* **Open source.** The core protocol and example laws are and will always remain open source.
* **Simplicity.** In developing the protocol simplicity is prioritised over gas efficiency.
* **Composability.** The protocol integrates seamlessly with a range of on- and off-chain services, existing DAOs, as well as with other implementations of the protocol. There will be integration modules available for existing governance solutions such as OpenZeppelin's Governor.sol and the Hats protocol.
* **Security.** The protocol should not be allowed to govern actual assets before being properly audited and being subject to a well funded bounty program. This also applies to future upgrades and (current and future) law implementations.

## Milestones

### v0.3 (future)

* Implement integration modules for existing protocols.
* Implement integration for off-chain services.
* Revise naming of function and variables in Powers.sol.
* Further develop and simplify laws.
* Improve error handling.

### v0.2 (current)

* Simplified Powers.sol
* Implemented modular laws.
* Implemented dynamic UI / UX to interact with a wide range of governance structures.
* Renamed the protocol to Powers protocol.

### v0.1

* First PoC of Role restricted governance protocol. Initially named Separated Powers.
* Build for the RnDao's CollabTech hackathon in Oct-Nov 2024.
