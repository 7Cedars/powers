# Protocol development

## Aims

There are several aims and ethos that guide the development of the Powers protocol.

* **Open source.** The core protocol and example laws are and will always remain open source.
* **Simplicity.** In developing the protocol whenever a trade of between the two emerges, simplicity is prioritised over gas efficiency.
* **Composability.** Laws provide a fully composable layer of smart contracts that integrates seamlessly with a range of on- and off-chain services, existing DAOs, as well as with other implementations of the protocol.&#x20;
* **Security.** No protocol will ever be a 100% safe. But a governance protocol that divides powers allows for the elimination of single points of failure. It allowis for new levels of security in on-chain governance. &#x20;
* **Community.** Protocol development and security are demand constant attention. The ultimate aim is to create a sustainable community that develops and secure the protocol.&#x20;

## Milestones

### v0.3 (under development)

* Implement integration modules for existing protocols.
* Implement integration for off-chain services.
* Revise naming of function and variables in Powers.sol.
* Refactor laws into singleton contracts.&#x20;
* Improve error handling.

### v0.2 (current)

* Simplified Powers.sol
* Implemented modular laws.
* Implemented dynamic UI / UX to interact with a wide range of governance structures.
* Renamed the protocol to Powers protocol.

### v0.1

* First PoC of Role restricted governance protocol. Initially named Separated Powers.
* Build for the RnDao's CollabTech hackathon in Oct-Nov 2024.
