## The pragmatic case

Role restricted governance protocols offer several powerful advantages that make them stand out among existing governance solutions. They excel in simplicity, efficiency, modularity, and flexibility, while introducing innovative features that enhance community governance.

### Assigning roles

The Powers protocol provides a robust and flexible framework for encoding how roles are assigned to accounts: Communities can implement any mechanism they desire for allocating roles but they always have to use established governance mechanisms.&#x20;

It allows token hodlers, builders, validators, institutional members, users or any other stake holder in the community to be contractually represented.

It also allows the use of existing protocols, such as the Hats protocol, to be used for role management.&#x20;

### Voting power

One of the most powerful features is that accounts vote with their roles, not with their tokens. It creates a democratic "1 account = 1 vote" system similar to multisig wallets. This approach ensures clear, straightforward voting mechanics and promotes equal representation within roles.

Communities can enhance this system by implementing sophisticated role assignment mechanisms based on token holdings. As demonstrated in Example B above, this enables flexible governance structures that can incorporate token-based influence while maintaining the benefits of role-based voting.

### Governance chains

A powerful innovation of the protocol is its support for governance chains through consistent proposal ID calculation. By using the same calldata and nonce across different laws, governance actions can be tracked along governance chains.

This feature allows communities to create sophisticated checks and balances between different roles, enabling seamless coordination between different governance layers, through robust decision-making processes that reflect their unique needs.

### Multi Calls

The protocol offers powerful multi-call functionality. While each transaction executes one law at a time, that law can trigger multiple actions through the Powers protocol, enabling efficient and coordinated governance actions.

### Integrations

Powers protocol provides out-of-the-box support for async governance actions. This allows for any type of oracle to be seamlessly integrated into governance actions: randomise allocation of roles, automate governance actions, integrate off-chain voting mechanisms, allow conditional actions based on market conditions, or integrate AI agents in a governance work-flow. Everything is possible.

The protocol also comes with integration modules for popular existing governance protocols such as OpenZeppelin's Governor.sol and Haberdasher's Hats protocol. &#x20;

### Upgradability

The protocol provides excellent flexibility in upgradability. Communities can choose their desired level of mutability by implementing laws for adopting and revoking other laws. This modular approach allows for precise control over governance evolution, with changes possible on a law-by-law basis.

The upgrade process inherently incorporates existing governance checks, allowing communities to implement exactly the level of security and flexibility they need. Whether a community desires rock-solid immutability or dynamic adaptability, the Powers protocol can accommodate their preferences.
